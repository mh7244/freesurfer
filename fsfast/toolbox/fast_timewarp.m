function twarp = fast_timewarp(t,indpeak)
% twarp = fast_timewarp(t,indpeak)
%
% Change time so that the duration between peaks is constant and equal
% to the period=mean(diff(t(indpeak))). This is used for cases where
% there is a quasiperiodic process (like heat beat or respiration)
% where the time between peaks varies from cycle to cycle. This can be
% used in RETROICOR. For a truly periodic process, twarp=tresp (or
% very close to it). The time between peaks of the twarp should have
% the same/close mean of that for t but the stddev should be zero (or
% close to it). When the quasiperiodic process is plotted with
% twarp instead of t, then it should appear periodic.
